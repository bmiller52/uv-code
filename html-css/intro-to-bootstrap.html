										<h2>Introduction</h2>
									</header>
									<p>In order to create any beginner website, you need to know how to use a framework. A framework establishes the style formatting, acting like a foundational structure to the website. A great example of that is Bootstrap. Like most frameworks, it includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as its main functions. <!--not sure if this next sentence is accurate or what you were trying to say?-->While it is mostly a generic setup, one way Bootstrap is unique to other frameworks is its incredibly extensive CSS file package, which contains more than 9,000 lines of code. Although this sounds pretty overwhelming, it actually isn't much of a problem for us web designers: we don't have to deal with the CSS unless we want to make a specific change to the structure of our website that varies from Bootstrap's default CSS. Another excellent feature to Bootstrap is its full-flegded documentation, which contains countless examples, demonstrations, and provisions for building your website. This documentation is extremely useful and allows for rapid, simple work when creating your website. Bootstrap is so naturally effective to work with, in fact, that significant companies such as Spotify and Lyft use this framework for their websites, carving the way for Bootstrap's increasing popularity. In many ways, Bootstrap is extremely helpful to use, though that doesn't exclude it from some natural setbacks as well.</p>

									<h4>Pros</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>Simple documentation</li>
										<li>Causes quick and efficient workflow</li>
										<li>Customizable content</li>
										<li>Works in all modern browsers</li>
										<li>Responsive</li>
									</ul>

									<h4>Cons</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>Your website can become generic</li>
										<li>CSS can be diffucult to customize</li>
										<li>jQuery plugins are limited</li>
									</ul>

									<p>A common problem is the generic aspect of Bootstrap. You're using the same code from the documentation that everybody else uses. However, the CSS is a customizable addition to the framework, and can be edited and morphed into however you want it to look like. With the sacrifice of some extra time, the stereotypical image of Bootstrap can be dramatically changed with edits to the CSS. </p>

									<!--I would consider deleting this section, since it is pretty irrelevent to the main topic. Maybe save this information for whenever you're doing tutorials on other frameworks that doesn't focus directly on a specific framework, such as this one with Bootstrap. <header class="major">
										<h2>Other Frameworks</h2>
									</header>
									<p>While it is argually one of the easiest to use, Bootstrap isn't the only great framework out there. There are some other ones that are becoming more popular, like <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a> or <a href="http://getskeleton.com/">Skeleton</a>. They all result in the same problem with websites all looking the same. Try some others out and see if you like them.</p>

										<h2>Getting started with Bootstrap</h2>
									</header>
									<p>The first introductory set-up page in the documentation is a pretty self-explainatory walkthrough, but before you get started, there is one helpful tip to recognize. On the beginning pages, you may notice some code snippets with links to CSS and Javascript files. These will lead you to webaddresses which will work, but are unaccessable to change or edit since they're being pulled from the web. However, if you download all of these files, then link to your local file, you can now have full customizable power over your Javascript and CSS. That's a lot of power! In addition to this, one last recommendation is to use the starter template below the Quick Start. This will really help you to have a basis to your code; it acts as the "framework for the framework". Everything else from here is mostly self-explainatory if you follow the documentation's instructions. Have fun with your website!</p>
