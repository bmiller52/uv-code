										<h2>Introduction</h2>
									</header>
									<p>What are functions? In simple terms, they are blocks of code that can be reused however many times you want to call on them. Python already comes with predefined functions like <b>print()</b> and <b>raw_input()</b>. However, as coders we can still make our own functions to make the code cleaner and more compact. By typing in <b>def</b> (which  abbreviates define), the function name, followed by an opening and closing parentheses and a colon, you've created a function. From there, you can fill it with whatever you need to be inside that function.</p>

									<p class="code-display">
										def profile_setup():<br>
										&nbsp;&nbsp;question1 = raw_input('Hello, what is your name? ')<br>
										&nbsp;&nbsp;question2 = raw_input('How old are you? ')<br>
										&nbsp;&nbsp;question3 = raw_input('What\'s your occupation? ')<br>
										<br>
										&nbsp;&nbsp;print()
										&nbsp;&nbsp;print('Name: ' + question1)<br>
										&nbsp;&nbsp;print('Age: ' + question2)<br>
										&nbsp;&nbsp;print('Occupation: ' + question3)<br>
									</p>

									<p>While this is a correctly formatted function, nothing will happen if this code is run in a script or the Python console. The reason for this is that we only defined the function, but never called it. This can easily be fixed by typing in the function name and parenthesis.</p>
									<p class="code-display">profile_setup()</p>
									<p>By calling it, the code set up inside the function will run, prompting the three questions, then outputting the responses. This is extremely useful, since it allows you to reuse the same pieces of code however many times needed. Now, when needing a large segment of code multiple times to be run throughout the rest of the code, that code can be put inside a function, and called on seperately each time. Several other useful benefits to functions is how they eliminate higher chances of syntax errors and repetitively convoluted code. </p>

									<header class="major">
										<h2>Going Further with Functions</h2>
									</header>
									<p>What if the user wants to enter in some other code including the function's code, before actually running the function?  Many coders will do this to determine the output of the function. Here's a basic example of this.</p>

									<p class="code-display">
										def do_math(x, y):<br>
										&nbsp;&nbsp;calculation = x + y<br>
										&nbsp;&nbsp;return calculation<br>
										<br>
										num1 = int(raw_input('Pick any number '))<br>
										num2 = int(raw_input('Pick another number '))<br>
										<br>
										do_math(num1, num2)
									</p>

									<p>This script allows the user to determine two numbers that the function will add. What is inside the parenthesis when defining the function is arbitrary: they are essentially variables. Notice the <b>int</b> function (a pre-defined Python function) that is outside of the <b>raw_input</b>. Without this, the program wouldn't run. In simple terms, it parses whatever the user inputs to be read as an integer. Otherwise, the console would look at it as a string and would concatenate it, which isn't what we want in this example. This way, though, it adds the two numbers by recognizing them as integers and through this function method.</p>

									<header class="major">
										<h2>Conclusion</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Functions are very commonly used by the most professional Python coders, but they aren't a difficult concept to grasp, which is why they are so universally used. With this in your pocket, it will be much easier to work with Python, especially for coding DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). In games, programs, and practically any other use for Python, functions are essential to keeping your code clean and DRY. </p>
